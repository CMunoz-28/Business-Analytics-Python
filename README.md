<p>This GitHub repository contains various files and datasets created from my coursework in Business Analytics & Intelligence using Python. 
  
One of the most valuable benefits I've gained from my journey in analytics is improved insight into datasets. I'm excited about leveraging Python for statistical analysis and creating simple visualizations from these datasets. This experience has deepened my understanding of data and its potential to drive business decisions.</p>
